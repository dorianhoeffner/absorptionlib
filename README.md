### Installation and Unsage

```
pip install absorptionlib
```

```python
# Import
from absorptionlib import NaOH, LiBr, LiCl, CaCl2

# Example Usage
p = 100000 # [Pa]
x = 0.4    # [%]  = [kgNaOH / kgSolution]
t_sat = NaOH.saturation_temperature(p, x)
print(t_sat)
```

# Quick documentation
Each of the submodules have their own "in-line" documentation, which can be called by the "documentation"-method. Each thermophysical property function has a separate docstring, which can be called by the "explain"-method.

```python
# How to get quick documentation on the modules
NaOH.documentation() # or
LiBr.documentation() # or
LiCl.documentation() # or
CaCl2.documentation()

# How to get quick documentation for functions
NaOH.explain("enthalpy")    # returns docstring for NaOH.enthalpy
LiCl.explain("pTDiagram")   # returns docstring for LiCl.pTDiagram
```
